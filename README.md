# Floorplan-Optimizer  - A Bachelor project
## Abstract
Floorplan optimizing is a np-hard problem and there are many statring requirements taht can be taken into consideration. </br>
This project's assumptions:
- All elements are rectangles
- Each element is a different _Type_, and each _type_ can have many _Variants_ of different sizes
- Each _Type_ can have requirements for its adjacent/neighboring _types_
- <b>No</b> maximum area size - The algorithm only calculates the smallest combination of _varaints_ and requirements

The alghoritm is mainly inspired from **[this](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~itf/dbpp/text/node21.html)**

### The raw algorithm without the GUI can be found **[here](https://github.com/MrChrisFix/Raw-Floorplan-Algorithm)** 

## Usage
TBA
